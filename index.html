                <h2>3. Toyota</h2>
                <p>Arguably one of the biggest and oldest companies in India goes by the name of Tata. Originally founded in 1868, the Tata name has been a part of Indian history for over 150 years. Tata has affiliates in almost every sector including communications, consumer products, power, steel, air-conditioning, hotels, airlines, and they even managed to fit Starbucks into their very impressive list. However, we are here to look at the Tata Motors side of things which started back in 1945 and currently holds 8.82 percent of the market share in the country. With so much history behind them, it comes as no surprise that Tata is one of the best-selling car manufacturers in India, and since revamping their lineup, buyers have been paying a lot of attention to the vehicles that roll out every year.</p>

                <p>South Korea and automobile manufacturers are a perfect match. It seems like whatever they put their hands to, turns into something great. KIA is just one of the many brands that come to mind and even though the company was founded in 1944, it entered the Indian market only in 2019. However, KIA hit the ground running with one of the most competitive SUVs in India - the Seltos. Although KIA currently has 5.41 percent of the market share in the country, there is no doubt that that number is going to rise in a few years.</p>

                <p>This is a name that you can never leave out when it comes to automobiles in India. Mahindra & Mahindra was founded in 1945 and is one of the top 20 companies in the country. When you think of a Mahindra vehicle, the first thing that comes to mind is durable, rugged, and spacious, and that is exactly what you get from every single car that Mahindra manufactures. Unfortunately, not everyone is looking for a vehicle that can take on all types of terrain, and this is why their market share is at about 4.99 percent. Nevertheless, Mahindra keeps doing what they know best and that is to produce some of the most powerful vehicles in the country.</p>

Tata Motors, in recent years, has even managed to make some place for itself in the highly competitive small car segment with the Tiago. On the other hand, the Safari Storme, its small SUV, has been losing out on popularity. Thankfully, however, the Harrier has been received well in the market and is likely to help the carmaker stay afloat in the SUV segment. The same can be said for the Nexon, which takes on some much-loved models like the Maruti Vitara Brezza and Hyundai Venue.</p>
